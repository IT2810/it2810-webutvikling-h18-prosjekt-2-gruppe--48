            "A near horizon whose sharp jags",
            "Cut brutally into a sky",
            "Of leaden heaviness, and crags",
            "Of houses lift their masonry",
            "Ugly and foul, and chimneys lie",
            "And snort, outlined against the gray",
            "Of lowhung cloud. I hear the sigh",
            "The goaded city gives, not day",
            "Nor night can ease her heart, her anguished labours stay.",
            "",
            "Below, straight streets, monotonous,",
            "From north and south, from east and west,",
            "Stretch glittering; and luminous",
            "Above, one tower tops the rest",
            "And holds aloft manâ€™s constant quest:",
            "Time!  Joyless emblem of the greed",
            "Of millions, robber of the best",
            "Which earth can give, the vulgar creed",
            "Has seared upon the night its flaming ruthless screed.",
            "",
            "O Night!  Whose soothing presence brings",
            "The quiet shining of the stars.",
            "O Night!  Whose cloak of darkness clings",
            "So intimately close that scars",
            "Are hid from our own eyes. Beggars",
            "By day, our wealth is having night",
            "To burn our souls before altars",
            "Dim and tree-shadowed, where the light",
            "Is shed from a young moon, mysteriously bright.",
            "",
            "Where art thou hiding, where thy peace?",
            "This is the hour, but thou art not.",
            "Will waking tumult never cease?",
            "Hast thou thy votary forgot?",
            "Nature forsakes this man-begot",
            "And festering wilderness, and now",
            "The long still hours are here, no jot",
            "Of dear communing do I know;",
            "Instead the glaring, man-filled city groans below!"
