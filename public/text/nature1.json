            "Does warm thee into being, through the ring",
            "Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling",
            "Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers",
            "Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,",
            "Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing",
            "To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;",
            "To fill the lonely with a joy untold;",
            "Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,",
            "To-morrow jewelled with raindrops.  Always bold",
            "To stand erect, full in the dazzling play",
            "Of April’s sun, for thou hast caught his gold."
