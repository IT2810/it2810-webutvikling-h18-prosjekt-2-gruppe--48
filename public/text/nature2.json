            "A little garden on a bleak hillside",
            "Where deep the heavy, dazzling mountain snow",
            "Lies far into the spring. The sun’s pale glow",
            "Is scarcely able to melt patches wide",
            "About the single rose bush. All denied",
            "Of nature’s tender ministries. But no, —",
            "For wonder-working faith has made it blow",
            "With flowers many hued and starry-eyed.",
            "Here sleeps the sun long, idle summer hours;",
            "Here butterflies and bees fare far to rove",
            "Amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers;",
            "Here four o’clocks, to the passionate night above",
            "Fling whiffs of perfume, like pale incense showers.",
            "A little garden, loved with a great love!"
